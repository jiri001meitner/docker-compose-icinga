# Example nftables rules

This directory contains nftables snippets generated by the deployment script.

- `2_docker_global.conf` – baseline rules that apply to Docker in general.
- `3_docker_icinga.conf` – rules specific to the Icinga stack produced with `nft_diff.py`.

Use these files as templates or run `./docker_deploy.sh /path/to/docker-compose-icinga`
from the repository root to create fresh rules and optionally install them to `/etc/nftables.d/`.
