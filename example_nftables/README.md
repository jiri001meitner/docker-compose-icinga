# Example nftables rules

This directory contains nftables snippets generated by the first-deployment script.

- `2_docker_global.conf` – baseline rules that apply to Docker in general.
- `3_docker_icinga.conf` – rules specific to the Icinga stack produced with `nft_diff.py`.

Use these files as templates or run `./docker_first_deploy.sh ./` from the repository
root to generate fresh rules for your environment. The script stops and removes existing Docker
containers together with their networks to capture a clean ruleset, installs the snippets to
`/etc/nftables.d/2_docker_global.conf` and `/etc/nftables.d/3_docker_icinga.conf`
(included via `/etc/nftables.conf`) and is required for the initial deployment.
